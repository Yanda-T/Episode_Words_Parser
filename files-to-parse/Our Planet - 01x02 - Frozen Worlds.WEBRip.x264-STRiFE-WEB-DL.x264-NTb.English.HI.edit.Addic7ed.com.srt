<i>Some humpbacks regularly work
in an even more coordinated way.</i>

<i>They do so
when krill has descended to some depth.</i>

<i>Once in position,
they blast air from their blowholes.</i>

<i>Working together,</i>

90

<i>they create a curtain of bubbles
around their prey.</i>

91
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,867
<i>As the spiraling net tightens,
the krill are driven closer together,</i>

92

<i>and then the whales lunge upwards
and collect them.</i>

93
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,483
<i>Almost all humpback whales
in the southern hemisphere</i>

<i>A penguin can outmaneuver

00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,071
<i>But the ice has retreated
away to the north,</i>

299
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,368
<i>and this is the closest place
to their feeding grounds,</i>

300
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,036
<i>where they can find rest.</i>

301
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,929
<i>This calf must stay close to its mother.</i>

302
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,524
<i>But every square inch is occupied.</i>

303
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,077
[grunting]

304
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>Climbing over
the tightly packed bodies</i>

305
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,382
<i>is the only way across the crowd.</i>

306
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,429
<i>Those beneath can get crushed to death.</i>

307
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,398
<i>A stampede can occur out of nowhere.</i>

308
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,717
<i>Under these conditions,
walruses are a danger to themselves.</i>

309
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,435
<i>Some manage to find space
away from the crowds.</i>

310
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>They struggle up the 80-meter cliffs,</i>

311
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,788
<i>an extraordinary challenge
for a one-tonne animal used to sea ice.</i>

312
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,929
<i>At least up here there's space to rest.</i>

313
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,523
<i>A walrus's eyesight out of water is poor,</i>

314
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
<i>but they can sense the others down below.</i>

315
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,454
<i>As they get hungry,
they need to return to the sea.</i>

316
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,252
<i>In their desperation to do so,</i>

317
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,840
<i>hundreds fall from heights
they should never have scaled.</i>

318
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:36,616
<i>These mass gatherings of walrus
are now happening almost every year.</i>

319
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:49,421
<i>So the lives of walruses,
like those of polar bears and seals,</i>

320
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,796
<i>are changing.</i>

321
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,636
<i>All are living at the frontier
of climate change,</i>

322
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,391
<i>and all are suffering as a consequence.</i>

323
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:26,333
<i>For now, the Arctic winter returns
and the sea ice reforms.</i>

324
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
<i>Order is restored.</i>

325
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,262
<i>Relief for the many creatures
that depend on the ice.</i>

326
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,277
<i>But for how much longer</i>

327
00:51:54,653 --> 00:52:00,200
<i>will their frozen worlds
be a part of life on our planet?</i>
